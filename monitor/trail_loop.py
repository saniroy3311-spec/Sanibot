monitor/trail_loop.py — Shiva Sniper v10 — PINE-EXACT-TRAIL
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROOT CAUSE OF ALL PREVIOUS DIVERGENCE (fixed in this version)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FIX-1 | Trail armed too early (CRITICAL — wrong exit prices)
OLD:  Trail armed when ANY profit > 0 (even 0.01 pts).
NEW:  Trail only arms when price crosses activation_price = entry ± trail_pts
where trail_pts = atr * pts_mult  (Pine exact: strategy.exit trail_points).
EFFECT: v10 was replacing the initial SL (e.g. 500 pts away) with a trail
SL just 320 pts from entry the instant price moved 0.01 pts favorable.
Any normal intrabar noise could then hit this tight SL for a loss
while Pine's trail wasn't even armed yet.
FIX-2 | SUPERSEDED — intrabar stage upgrades are DELIBERATELY ENABLED
OLD (FIX-2 as originally shipped): stage upgrades removed from _evaluate_tick(),
allowed only in on_bar_close() for strict Pine parity (calc_on_every_tick=false).
NOW (FIX-22, current behaviour): _evaluate_tick() step 3b upgrades the stage
intrabar off best_price, and on_bar_close() step 3 upgrades it again at close.
This is an INTENTIONAL deviation from Pine, kept for profit capture on fast
moves — it is not a bug and must not be "fixed" back to bar-close-only without
a measured TV comparison showing it loses money.
READ THIS BEFORE EDITING: the old wording above claimed bar-close-only and
directly contradicted the code at _evaluate_tick() step 3b, which has caused
repeated wrong diagnoses. Stage upgrades happen in BOTH places by design.
FIX-3 | Intrabar breakeven removed (MEDIUM — premature BE stop)
OLD:  _evaluate_tick() checked breakeven on every price tick.
NEW:  Breakeven check ONLY in on_bar_close() (Pine-exact).
EFFECT: v10's intrabar BE fired mid-bar; any pullback before bar close
hit the BE stop when Pine's BE wasn't yet active.
FIX-4 | Initial SL update every bar (MEDIUM — trailing behind Pine)
KEPT: on_bar_close() updates current_sl from live ATR each bar when trail
not yet armed — matches Pine's strategy.exit(stop=) recalculation.
FIX-11 | SUPERSEDED — Trail SL always fires intrabar (TV-exact)
Pine's strategy.exit(trail_points=, trail_offset=) fires intrabar on the exact
tick that breaches trail_sl — the Exit label plots mid-candle at that price.
BAR_CLOSE_SL_EVAL does NOT suppress trail SL. It only applies to the Initial SL
(pre-arm, from the strategy body which runs at bar close via calc_on_every_tick=false).
Once trail arms, strategy.exit() takes over and always fires intrabar.
The old FIX-11 was wrong — suppressing trail SL at bar close made the bot exit
at bar_low (often 30-150 pts worse than TV's intrabar exit tick).
FIX-12 | pre_trail_sl snapshot taken before trail arms — wrong exit level (NEW)
OLD:  on_bar_close() snapshotted pre_trail_sl = state.current_sl BEFORE step 5&6
(trail arm). When trail armed this bar, step 7 still used old initial_sl.
NEW:  Snapshot moved to AFTER step 5&6 so pre_trail_sl = new trail_sl if armed.
EFFECT: Trade 2: trail armed at bar_high=66263.5 → trail_sl=66225.
Old code: pre_trail_sl=initial_sl=65855 → fired "Initial SL" at 65855.
New code: pre_trail_sl=66225 → bar_low=65855 < 66225 → "Trail SL" at 66225.
FIX-15 | Trail SL breach hold guard — 4-second wick filter (NEW)
OLD:  Once TRAIL_SL_CONFIRM_TICKS consecutive Delta ticks breach the trail SL,
      exit fires instantly.
NEW:  After tick-count confirmation, a 4-second hold guard starts. The exit
      only fires if price stays below the trail SL for the full 4 seconds.
      If price recovers within the window (wick), the timer resets — no exit.
EFFECT: Trade with trail peak=61,470, trail SL=61,337: wick hit 61,315 for
      ~2 seconds then recovered to 61,374. Old code: exit at 61,337 (→ fill
      61,266 with slippage). New code: wick recovers in <4s → hold cancelled
      → bot holds and exits closer to TV's 61,374 level.
      Applies to trail-armed exits only. Initial SL, Max SL, TP unaffected.
FIX-5 | Offset recalibration mid-trade caused premature exit (NEW)
OLD:  _recalibrate_offset() fires every 30s and could jump offset by up to
50 pts in one step, instantly jerking the trail SL and causing exit.
NEW:  Once trail arms (_trail_ever_armed=True), recalibration is completely
frozen. Pre-arm recal is tightened to max 10 pts jump (was 50).
EFFECT: The +287 vs +453 trade exited early because offset jumped +36 pts
mid-trade. This makes that impossible.
FIX-6 | Binance offset drift corrupted best_price during fast moves (NEW)
OLD:  Both Binance (offset-adjusted) and Delta ticks called _evaluate_tick(),
which updates best_price. When spread widened (e.g. +40→+77 pts),
Binance ticks underestimated Delta price, so best_price didn't track
as deep as Pine's trail did.
NEW:  Post-arm, Binance ticks call _evaluate_tick_sl_only() which checks
TP/SL exits but does NOT update best_price. Only Delta ticks (push_delta_tick)
and the REST safety-net poll update best_price post-arm.
EFFECT: Trail tracks exactly as deep as Pine's trail does, closing the
~166 pt gap between bot and TradingView results.
HOW PINE'S trail_points / trail_offset WORKS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pine's strategy.exit(trail_points=P, trail_offset=O) internally does:
SHORT TRADE:
Step 1 — ACTIVATION:
activation_price = entryPrice - P   (P points below entry = profit)
Trail is NOT active until price <= activation_price
Step 2 — BEST PRICE (once armed):
  best_price = lowest price seen since trail armed (running min)

Step 3 — TRAIL SL:
  trail_sl = best_price + O
  Exit when current_price >= trail_sl
LONG TRADE:
activation_price = entryPrice + P
best_price = highest price seen since trail armed
trail_sl = best_price - O
Exit when current_price <= trail_sl
STAGE UPGRADES (bar close AND intrabar — see FIX-22)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pine upgrades trailStage when profitDist >= atr * triggerMult AT BAR CLOSE.
This bot ALSO upgrades intrabar off best_price (_evaluate_tick step 3b) —
a deliberate deviation from Pine, see FIX-22 above.
When stage upgrades, trail_sl recomputes from existing best_price.
best_price does NOT reset on stage upgrade.
BREAKEVEN (bar-close only)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pine: if profitDist > atr * beMult AT BAR CLOSE → SL floor = entryPrice.
Once BE fires, trail continues but SL can never go worse than entry.

# pattern but applied to offset recalibration instead of raw ticks.
# Plain FIX-5 compares every 30s candidate offset to the LAST ACCEPTED offset.
# If the real Binance↔Delta spread is genuinely walking (not noise), every
# candidate keeps landing >10pts from a now-stale reference and gets rejected
# forever — the offset (and therefore Initial SL / activation_price) freezes
# stale indefinitely with no way back, exactly like the tick feed could before
# FIX-14. Two independent recovery paths, either one re-syncs the offset:
# 1) STREAK: if N consecutive rejected candidates all move the SAME direction,
#    that's a real drift, not noise — accept the latest one and resume
#    tracking from there. A genuine single-cycle blip (jumps then reverts)
#    never satisfies "same direction N times running", so normal FIX-5
#    protection against a one-off bad read is untouched.
# 2) STALE TIMEOUT: if no candidate has been accepted for this long, the next
#    candidate is accepted unconditionally — covers a real, sustained spread
#    widening (funding event, thin liquidity, feed hiccup) that isn't
#    reverting on its own.
OFFSET_REJECT_STREAK_CONFIRM = 4      # consecutive same-direction rejects before override
OFFSET_STALE_TIMEOUT_S       = 60.0   # force-accept next candidate after this long stale (2 recal cycles @30s)

# FIX-13: Maximum single-tick jump allowed on the raw Delta price feed before
# a tick is treated as a noise wick and skipped entirely (not counted toward
# breach, not used to reset the breach counter — just ignored, as if it never
# arrived). Delta's own order book occasionally prints a single outlier tick
# (thin liquidity flash) that is not present on Binance/TV's data source.
# CHANGED FROM 20.0 TO 30.0 TO REDUCE FALSE POSITIVES ON FAST MOVES.
MAX_DELTA_TICK_JUMP = 30.0

# FIX-14: Recovery valves for FIX-13. The plain version of FIX-13 compares
# every tick to the LAST ACCEPTED tick. If one tick is ever wrongly rejected,
# that reference goes stale, and every following tick — even normal small
# moves — now reads as ">20pts from a stale number" and gets rejected too.
# The reference can lock up indefinitely with no way back, silently freezing
# best_price/trail during a real, fast, multi-tick rally (seen live on
# 2026-06-21, trade #350: ~70 real ticks rejected over 75s while price ran
# 64217→64267, costing ~35pts vs the TradingView trail exit on the same trade).
# Two independent recovery paths, either one re-syncs the reference:
# 1) STREAK: if N consecutive rejected ticks all move the SAME direction,
#    that's a real run, not repeated noise — accept the latest one and
#    resume normal tracking from there. A genuine single wick (jumps away
#    then snaps back) never satisfies "same direction N times in a row",
#    so the original FIX-13 protection is untouched.
# 2) STALE TIMEOUT: if no tick has been accepted for this many seconds,
#    the next tick is accepted unconditionally — covers feed gaps /
#    reconnects where price legitimately moved while we weren't listening.

WICK_STALE_TIMEOUT_S  = 5.0    # force-accept next tick after this long with none accepted

# FIX-15: Trail SL breach hold guard.
# Once tick-count confirmation fires (TRAIL_SL_CONFIRM_TICKS met), do NOT
# exit immediately. Instead require the price to stay BELOW the trail SL for
# this many wall-clock seconds before the exit fires.
#
# Problem it solves: the streak-override (FIX-14b) correctly identified a real
# 3-tick directional move and accepted 61,315 as a "real" tick — but that tick
# was still a wick (price recovered to 61,374 within ~2 seconds). Because the
# tick-count confirmation fired the exit instantly, the bot closed at 61,266
# (71pt slippage from 61,337 trail SL) while TV held and exited at 61,374.
#
# How it works:
#   1. Tick count reaches TRAIL_SL_CONFIRM_TICKS → hold timer starts (no exit).
#   2. Each subsequent confirming tick: checks how long price has stayed below SL.
#   3. If price recovers above SL within the window → timer resets, no exit.
#   4. If price stays below SL for >= TRAIL_SL_BREACH_HOLD_SECS → exit fires.
#
# Why 4 seconds: real wick spikes on BTC recover within 1-2 seconds. A genuine
# break stays below for 5+ seconds. 4s is the safe midpoint — catches real
# breaks while ignoring most wicks.
#
# Note: ONLY applies to trail-armed exits. Initial SL fires immediately as before
# (it uses BAR_CLOSE_SL_EVAL anyway). Max SL and TP are also unaffected.
TRAIL_SL_BREACH_HOLD_SECS = float(os.environ.get("TRAIL_SL_BREACH_HOLD_SECS", "4.0"))
# FIX-16: Once stage has upgraded past 0, trust the move faster
TRAIL_SL_BREACH_HOLD_SECS_STAGE_UP = float(os.environ.get("TRAIL_SL_BREACH_HOLD_SECS_STAGE_UP", "2.0"))

# FIX-19: one print back inside the SL no longer wipes the breach state.
RECOVER_CONFIRM_TICKS = int(os.environ.get("RECOVER_CONFIRM_TICKS", "2"))

# FIX-17: Large-breach fast exit (skip the hold guard on big, obvious moves).
#
# Problem it solves: FIX-15's hold guard is correct for small wicks (price
# dips a few points past the trail SL, then recovers) — waiting protects
# against false exits. But on a genuine fast move, price can keep falling
# for the entire hold window before the exit fires, turning a small trail
# breach into much larger slippage. Live example (2026-07-04, trade exit
# 23:46:05): trail SL was 63,312.44; by the time the 7s hold expired, price
# had fallen to 63,268.50 — a breach that had grown to ~44 points before the
# bot was even allowed to react, then several more points of order-fill
# slippage on top of that.
#
# Fix: as soon as tick-count confirmation fires, check how far price has
# already moved past the trail SL. If that distance is "large" (defined as
# a fraction of current ATR, so it auto-scales with volatility instead of
# using one fixed point value), skip the hold guard entirely and fire the
# exit immediately — same as the old "fire on tick confirm" behaviour, just
# scoped only to breaches large enough that waiting can't help. Small
# breaches (below this threshold) still go through the full FIX-15 hold
# guard, completely unchanged.
#
# TRAIL_SL_LARGE_BREACH_ATR_PCT: breach distance, as a percent of current
# ATR, above which the hold guard is skipped. Starting value below is a
# rough estimate — tune this using actual trade history rather than leaving
# it as a guess: look at how far genuine breakdowns vs. wicks that recovered
# moved past the SL, as a % of ATR at the time, and set the threshold
# between the two clusters.

# FIX-18: Rolling median smoothing for accepted Delta ticks (additional,

# single-outlier spikes, but it still lets through a tick that is real-ish
# but noisy — small feed jitter that isn't a "wick" by FIX-13's definition,
# yet still shifts best_price and the trail SL around on every tick.
#
# This takes the last TRAIL_MEDIAN_WINDOW *accepted* (post FIX-13/14) ticks
# and feeds _evaluate_tick() their median instead of the raw last tick. A
# single noisy tick can't move a median of several ticks much, so best_price
# / trail SL / breach checks all see a steadier number — without adding any
# extra hold-time delay (this is a per-tick smoothing, not a timer).
#
# TRAIL_MEDIAN_WINDOW=1 means "no smoothing" — median of one value is just
# that value. DEFAULT CHANGED 2026-07-18: 1 → 3. Costs nothing (no added
# delay, just smooths ticks that already arrived) and knocks down single-tick
# jitter before it reaches the breach counter. 5 is more aggressive smoothing
# at the cost of reacting slightly slower to genuine fast moves. Wick-jump
# rejection (FIX-13) still runs on the RAW tick before it enters this window,
# so the two defenses stack rather than replace each other.

        noisy or momentarily-stale poll move best_price / the breach counter
